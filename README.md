# climate-news-NLP

This project involves using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify content from news articles as 'relevant to climate change' or not. The dataset was created by web scraping from a few news websites, and can be found in the repository as a .csv file. The code used to perform this data collection is at the start of the main Colab notebook, and can be run again to scrape more recent news articles.
